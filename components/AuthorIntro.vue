      I'm a tech enthusiast who spends my days tinkering with LLMs, fine-tuning models like GPT and
      playing with tools like LangChain and AutoGPT. When I'm not diving deep into prompt
      engineering or analyzing model behaviors, you'll find me experimenting with my home-brewed
      coffee setup (my Timemore C2 grinder is my pride and joy). I love combining my passions -
      whether it's building data pipelines while sipping a perfect pour-over, or brainstorming AI
      projects during my gym sessions. My garage houses both classic cars and a home server rack
      where I run my ML experiments. This website itself is a testament to my AI exploration - it's
      largely AI-generated, serving as a practical experiment in human-AI collaboration. Through
      this space, I'm documenting my journey in the fascinating world of generative AI, from custom
      model training to practical applications. Let's connect and geek out about the future of AI,
      cars, or the perfect coffee ratio!
